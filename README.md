# **Analyzing and Predicting AAPL and TSLA Stock Prices**

# Abstract
This project, ‘Analyzing and Predicting AAPL and TSLA Stock Prices’, explores the 
application of AI and Data Science techniques in predicting stock prices. The project focuses 
on two globally influential companies, Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Tesla Inc. (TSLA), and 
leverages seven years of historical stock price data collected from finance.yahoo.com.
The data was preprocessed and analyzed using tools like Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and 
Seaborn. Linear regression models were built and trained using Scikit-Learn, achieving an 
accuracy of 99.25% and 98.18% in predicting AAPL and TSLA stock prices respectively. The 
project also delves into the impact of significant events, such as the Covid-19 pandemic, 
inclusion in S&P500, etc. on stock prices.
The results demonstrate the potential of AI and Data Science in financial forecasting and 
provide valuable insights for investors and stakeholders. However, the inherent uncertainty of 
stock markets is acknowledged, and the predictions are intended to serve as a guide rather than 
a definitive forecast.


# Problem Statement
The financial market is a sophisticated system in which a wide range of variables interact in 
complex ways to affect stock values. Accurately predicting these values is difficult because of 
their volatility and the wide range of affecting factors. By projecting the stock values of two 
highly significant firms in the world, Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Tesla Inc. (TSLA), this research 
seeks to answer this difficulty.
"Can we correctly analyze the stock prices and carry out diagnostic analysis alongside 
developing a model that accurately predicts the future stock prices of AAPL and TSLA based 
on historical data?" is the specific problem this project aims to solve. We will use a variety of 
AI and Data Science tools like Python libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, 
Scikit-Learn, etc. and approaches like Exploratory Data Analysis and Regression to evaluate 
past stock price data and create a predictive model in order to respond to this issue. We will 
perform majority of this project in Jupyter notebooks.
The project's success will be determined by how well our model predicts the future. A good 
conclusion would offer important insights into the elements influencing these prices in addition 
to proving that stock prices can be predicted using AI and data science techniques.

# Methodology
1. Data Collection
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
4. Model Building
5. Model Evaluation
6. Prediction

These steps are well explained in the notebook.

# Conclusion
This project, ‘Analyzing and Predicting AAPL and TSLA Stock Prices’, has demonstrated 
the potential of AI and Data Science in predicting stock prices with high accuracy. The linear 
regression models built and trained on seven years of historical data were able to predict the 
stock prices of AAPL and TSLA with an accuracy of 99.25% and 98.18% respectively.
The exploratory data analysis provided valuable insights into the factors influencing stock 
prices, such as the significant impact of the Covid-19 pandemic in early 2020. These insights 
could be invaluable for investors and stakeholders in making informed decisions.
However, it’s important to note that while the model showed high accuracy, stock market 
predictions are inherently uncertain and influenced by numerous unpredictable factors. 
Therefore, the predictions made by the model should be used as a guide rather than a definitive 
forecast.
The success of this project opens up several avenues for future work. More sophisticated 
models could be explored to improve prediction accuracy. Additionally, other factors such as 
news sentiment and macroeconomic indicators could be incorporated into the model to capture 
a wider range of influences on stock prices.
In conclusion, this project has shown that with the right tools and methodologies, AI and Data 
Science can provide valuable insights and predictions in the complex world of stock market 
prices.
